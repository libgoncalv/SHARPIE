# SHARPIE
## Shared Human-AI Reinforcement Learning Platform for Interactive Experiments
[![Demo](https://github.com/libgoncalv/SHARPIE/blob/main/home/static/home/preview_image_1.png)](https://archive.org/embed/sharpie_demo_1_noaudio_captions)

Our framework is relying on Django for serving files to the user browser. Therefore, it is following the architecture of Django to organize the code i.e. decomposition of the pages in apps.

In this repository, each use-case described in our paper is a separate app, which translates to a different folder. For clarity we will detail briefly here the important files in our project but we highly recommend to look at the Django documentation for a better understanding.

### Common files for all apps
* `manage.py` is the framework manager, it allows you to easily launch your website and refreshes automatically to perform live testing.
* `sharpie/` is the folder holding the configuration of your website.
  * `settings.py` declares all the Django libraries you are going to use, which applications are available, where the HTML templates or the static files (e.g. CSS, JS, images, etc) are located in your project, how those files are served, etc.
  * `urls.py` declares which apps are available and what is their base url on your website
  * `asgi.py` declares how the protocols are handled by the (asynchronous) server and in particular the websockets
  * `websocket.py` declares the WebsocketTemplate that can be used by each app and takes care of syncronization
  * `templates/base.html` defines the menu as well as the footer of the pages and is included in all other templates.
* `db.sqlite3` DB file used by the website.

### Specific files for an app
* `templates/[app_folder]/` holds the HTML templates that are served by your app.
  * `config.html` configuration page of the app.
  * `run.html` experiment page of the app.
* `static/[app_folder]/` holds the static files that are served by your app.
  * `js/script.js` JS code for the interactions on `run.html` and the connection to the websocket of the server.
  * `run/` various files needed during the experiment like the rendered environment or the saved agent policy.
* `urls.py` declares which pages are available in your app. By default, only declares two views (i.e. pages): `config` and `run`.
* `views.py` defines what happens when a user queries a given URL. By default, only defines two views (i.e. pages): `config` and `run`.
  * `config` takes care of displaying, checking and saving in the user's session all the configuration variables needed for the experiment.
  * `run` loads the needed informations for displaying the experiment page.
* `forms.py` defines the forms needed for our experiment. By default only defines `ConfigForm` that is loaded in `views.py/config`
* `websocket.py` main component of your applications that will take care of the communication with the user. By default only defines `Consumer`. 
* `settings.py` settings of your app (at least app_name and app_folder)

## Development installation
* We highly recommend to use a virtual environment such as Anaconda. This code has been tested on Python 3.10.
* Git clone this repository
* Install [Redis server](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-redis/) `apt install redis-server` (on Ubuntu/Linux) or `brew install redis`
* Start Redis
* Install apps requirements (depending on what you what to try)
  * AMaze `pip install PyQt5 amaze-benchmarker`
  * Simple Spread and Simple Tag `pip install tensorflow pettingzoo[mpe]`
  * MineRL `pip install git+https://github.com/minerllabs/minerl`
* Install SHARPIE requirements `pip install django channels[daphne] channels_redis django-crispy-forms crispy-bootstrap4 ezpickle opencv-python-headless`
* Initialize the database by running the database migration: `python manage.py migrate`
* Uncomment the apps you want to try in `sharpie/settings.py`, `sharpie/urls.py` and `sharpie/asgi.py`
* Run `python manage.py runserver`

## Create your own app
* Run `sh create_app.sh [app_name] [app_folder]`
* Add the folder name to INSTALLED_APPS in sharpie/settings.py
* Add the folder name to the urlpatterns in sharpie/urls.py
* Add the folder name to the websocket in sharpie/asgi.py
* In your new app, (at least) modify static/js/script.js and websocket.py to suit your needs!

## Run into production
Follow the instructions on Django website and don't forget to change the secret key (otherwise you might get some surprises...).

## TODO
- [ ] Add agent in Minecraft
- [ ] Add text area to be able to specify tasks in Minecraft
- [ ] Add use-case with utility elicitation in Deep Sea Treasure
- [ ] Add use-case with shared decision support in Water-reservoir

## FAQ
**Q**: *How long will SHARPIE be supported?*  
A: SHARPIE is currently under active development, a request for support budget (a.o.) for 2025
is in preparation and we will continue do so until the end of the [HI
center](https://www.hybrid-intelligence-centre.nl/) in 2029.

**Q**: *Can SHARPIE integrate with environmnet X?*  
A: SHARPIE integrates with any environment that implements the
[Gymnasium ``env``](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/env/) API: SHARPIE needs access to 
``step()``, ``reset()`` and ``render()`` functions. Since SHARPIE runs the environment on a
back-end server rather than in the browser, it supports any environment with Python bindings to these
functions.

**Q**: *Does SHARPIE support experiments involving mixed human-AI teams?*  
A: SHARPIE is designed to support mixed human-AI teams, involving multiple AI agents and multiple
human participants at the same time. The SHARPIE architecture includes a back-end to manage
synchronization between participants, and rendering for you.

**Q**: *What are the computational requirements for SHARPIE*  
A: SHARPIE itself does not come with strict computational requirements, we suggest that you follow
the computational requirements of your environment and RL model of choice.

**Q**: *Can I use SHARPIE to run experiments involving participants from different continents?*  
A: It depends. Having participants located in different continents in the same room is likely to
cause latency issues that are fundamental to the nature of cross-continental networking.
Separating participants per room may be a viable alternative if your experimental setup support
this.

**Q**: *Why did you develop SHARPIE?*  
A: We developed SHARPIE to facilitate experiments involving RL agents and humans. We believe that
the study of this interaction is crucial to establishing artificial intelligence(s) that do not
replace human intellect but instead expand it. We thereby want to put humans at the centre,
and change the course of the ongoing AI revolution.

**Q**: *Can SHARPIE be used for education and outreach?*  
A: SHARPIE can be used for educational purposes and outreach. However, it is currently still under
active development. We plan to develop educational materials on hybrid human-AI systems and
experiments once the platform stabilizes.
